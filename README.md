The project's primary objective was to develop a predictive model to identify potential black swan events in the Florida housing market using Freddie Mac Housing Data, with a focus on understanding the market's response to unforeseen events like the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, various data sources were leveraged, including Freddie Mac's house price index, employment data, housing units data, appraisal data, and social media sentiment data. The methodology involved integrating sentiment analysis with traditional economic data and using machine learning models such as ARIMA, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Notably, the XGBoost model incorporating public sentiment showed a 14.83% reduction in error rate compared to the base model. Challenges included limited post-2020 data availability and high-quality data acquisition costs.
